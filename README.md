## Ptolemy Barnes
I am a full-stack web-developer aspiring to write clean, lean, and modular code. I am currently based in Barcelona, Spain.

I first 'pushed' a website to production for a school geography project in 2001, but it wasn't until years later that I picked up Ruby and got hooked on the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. Shortly after I decided to make the jump into the world of software development, finding a community and profession within which I feel at home.

### Employment
**ThoughtWorks Spain** - Consultant Developer, (May '19 - Present)
- [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) is a global technology consultancy renowned as an early adopter of processes and practices now considered industry standard. I am part of a stack-agnostic team committed to agile, TDD, and pair programming.

**Workshare** - Full Stack Developer, (June '18 - May'19)
- [Workshare](https://www.workshare.com/) is a tool for managing the lifecycle of a legal transaction. I worked across a microservices architecture, with React on the frontend.

**OneMaths** - Full Stack Developer, (January '18 - April '18)
- [OneMaths](https://onemaths.com) is an e-learning service for maths students. I consulted for this early-stage startup to help flesh out their feature-set.

**Trainline** - Front End Developer, (January '17 - January '18)
- [Trainline](https://trainline.com) is a digital rail platform. At trainline I deployed daily to production as part of a cross-functional team using node, react, and c#.

**Tifosy** - Full Stack Developer, (March '16 - January '17)
- [Tifosy](https://tifosy.com) is a crowd-funding start-up targeted at sports teams and organizations. I worked across the stack to build a system that generates certificates, complex UI flows, and integrations with third-party payment services. I've also used benchmarking and monitoring tools to debug performance issues.

**Makers Academy** - Developer/Coach, (March '15 - March '16)
- [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) is an intensive programming 'bootcamp' based in Shoreditch, London. As a coach, I juggled leading stand-ups, running workshops and retros, deepening my understanding of OOP, debugging students' issues, conducting code-reviews, and working on the website and internal tools.

### Craftsmanship
I learned software development through the lens of software craftsmanship and extreme programming. I learned that good **communication**, disciplined **refactoring**, and a coherent  **testing** strategy are essential to building maintainable software. Earlier this year I attended a week-long masterclass given by [Fred George](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fred-george-5965b5), deepening my understanding of design patterns in object-oriented programming.

### Communication
As a coach at **Makers Academy** I led stand-ups and retros with teams of aspiring developers. This experience left me with the belief that teams succeed or fail on the quality of their communication. When I'm programming or making a comment on a PR, I always try to ask myself the question: 'How is this going to be understood by another developer?'

I recently went to a series of [NVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) workshops where I wore giraffe ears and had my understanding of 'good communication' totally transformed.

When not programming I like to spend my time outside, usually cycling. I've competed internationally in beach volleyball, football, and ultimate frisbee. After founding an ultimately unsuccessful bagel start-up, I have been an amateur baker in search of the perfect rise.

### Skills
##### **Languages**

- Object-oriented **Ruby** or **JavaScript** is how I usually solve a problem. I am an aspiring Clojurian/Rich Hickey fan.
- **Node**. I always use side-projects or [hackathons](https://github.com/ptolemybarnes/frontliners-api) as an excuse to write in Node. I find Node's asynchronous programming model mind-expanding to work with.
- **Functional**. I've been exploring the functional paradigm in JavaScript with libraries such as Ramda and Underscore.

##### **Frameworks**
- **Rails**. Rails is a beast best grabbed by the horns. Recently I have been trying to understand how to apply tools such as [Trailblazer](https://github.com/apotonick/trailblazer) and [Interactor](https://github.com/collectiveidea/interactor) to build scalable and maintainable Rails apps.
- **Express**. Express is my first-choice node.js framework.
- **React/Redux**. I have a great deal of experience developing performant and testable React components. In 2017 I attended a 2-day React workshop at React Europe, Paris, where the emphasis was on creating functional, reusable, components. 

##### **Test Frameworks**
- **RSpec + Capybara**. I learned everything I know from [ThoughtBot](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/).
- I have also used **Jasmine** and **Jest** extensively.
- For **React**, I reach for **Enzyme**.

##### Database & ORMs
- Through Rails I have experience with **Postgres** and **ActiveRecord** and understand how to optimize queries to avoid common issues, such as n+1. More recently I have used **Redis** both as a data store and caching layer.

##### Teaching/Coaching
- After graduating I trained for the CELTA, a teaching qualification run by Cambridge University, and subsequently taught primary-aged children in the Republic of Korea for 2.5 years. I still enjoy leading workshops and helping others understand new concepts.

#### Other Qualifications
- NAUI Scuba Diver's license.
- Sailing license

### Academic

#### The University of Sheffield, Sheffield (2010 - 2011)
- **MA, Historical Research (Distinction)**. My MA thesis on the philosophy of history was awarded the
George Richard Potter prize, given to the highest-graded MA thesis of the academic year.

#### The University of Sheffield, Sheffield (2007 - 2010)
- **BA, History (First Class Honours).**
