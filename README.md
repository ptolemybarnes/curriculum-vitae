# Ptolemy Barnes

I am a full-stack web-developer with a passion for outside-in, behaviour driven, development. 
I aspire to write clean, lean, and modular code. In December '14 I began a 12-week immersive web-development
course at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) in Shoreditch, London, during which I met a lot of amazing people, wrote a lot of code, won a Hackerthon, and worked with local clients on real projects.

When the weather's fine I like to be outdoors, preferably on a bike. I have competed internationally
in volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and football. Since co-founding a sadly unprofitable
bagel start-up, I have been an amateur baker in search of the perfect rise.
