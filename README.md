I am a full-stack web-developer with a passion for test-driven development. I aspire to write clean, lean, and modular code.

When the weather's fine I like to be outdoors, preferably on a bike. I have competed internationally
in volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and football. Since co-founding a sadly unprofitable
bagel start-up, I have been an amateur baker in search of the perfect rise.

## Employment

**Tifosy**  (March '16 - )
- [Tifosy](tifosy.com) is a crowd-funding platform targeted at sports teams and organizations. I have been building new features across the stack, pushing to production daily.

**Makers Academy** (March '15 - March '16)
- [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) is an intensive programming 'bootcamp' based in Shoreditch, London. As a coach, I led groups of students beginning their careers as software developers. This required deep reflection on the best-practices of object-oriented programming.
